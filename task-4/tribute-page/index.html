    <h2>A time line of Albert Einstein:</h2>
      <li><span class="year">1879 - </span>Born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1895 - </span>At the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1896 - </span>He passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1900 - </span>Passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal teaching diploma.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1901 - </span>Secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1903 - </span>His position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1905 - </span>Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, serving as pro-forma advisor. His thesis was accepted in July of the same year.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1905 - </span>has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1906 - </span>Was awarded a PhD on January 15.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1908 - </span>Was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1911 - </span>Became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1913 - </span>Was enticed to move to Berlin with an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling him to concentrate exclusively on research.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1915 - </span>Had successfully completed his general theory of relativity, which he used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of Mercury.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1919 - </span>The deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1920 - </span>He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1922 - </span>Was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1933 - </span>Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1939 - </span>a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.[146] He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1940 - </span>Einstein became an American citizen.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1946 - </span>Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree.</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1954 - </span> Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ..."</li>
      <div class="i-line"></div>
      <li><span class="year">1955 - </span>Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.</li>
